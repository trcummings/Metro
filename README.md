# Metro

## A Lightweight Clone of Ruby's famous Rails

Metro combines a bare-bones ORM with a bare-bones MVC based on Rails' ActiveRecord and MVC, respectively. These bones may be bare, but they'll get you there!

### Seeing an example

Clone in, bundle install, and run ruby lib/server.rb

check out localhost:3000/howdoilook
check out localhost:3000/counter
check out localhost:3000/cats
